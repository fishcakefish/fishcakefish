### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shaun. Having been raised in Mountain View, I've naturally been surrounded by and engaged with technology my entire life. This early exposure paved the way for my interests in areas like eSports, where I got a head start in developing abilities like team collaboration or strategic decision-making, reaching notable achievements in that industry, mainly through consistency developing other skills. Enough colleagues from both online and home eventually convinced me to pursue CS, and I've been thriving since.
